# convert-decimal-number-to-binary-in-cpp
Converting decimal number taken from user input to binary number

In the code file i have used integer data types only to convert an decimal number to binary number.
The algorithm for this code is :  
  1. Take input number
  2. While the inputted number is grater than 1
  
    1. get the remainder using % operator
    2. divide the number by 2 and save it in itsel
    3. use an array to store number as binary number
    4. increment the counter for the binary array
  
  3. Print the binary array in reverse that's your binary number.
