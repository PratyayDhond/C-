# Max-consecutive-ones-in-binary
The program converts user inputted decimal no. to binary no and counts and prints the max number of consecutive one's in the binary number. (Doesn't accept float or double type input)

Algorithms:<br>
      For converting decimal to binary 
      
   1.temp = number%2 <br>
   2.number = number/2 <br>
   3.binary[i] = temp;  <br>
   4.increment the iterator <em>'i'</em> by one <br>
